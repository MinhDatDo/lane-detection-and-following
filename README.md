Our first task is to implement an algorithm so that the car bot can detect lane and follow it. We implemented lane detection with OpenCV and cv-bridge libraries in ROS and then use PID controller for the lane following. This link of youtube below shows our result sofar. This is just a demo with rough implementation.
